          Hi, I’m Bobbie. I am a UX designer with over 12 years experience
          working in healthcare and wellness promotion. I have seen many
          problems in the healthcare industry, many of which I strongly believe
          can be solved through technology and functional design. I want to
          solve these problems, using my compassionate nature in caring for
          others, creative ability, and passion for research and design. My
          current position is at a healthcare start-up company where I work as a
          virtual nurse. I work alongside the PYM team. I am excited to expand
          my research and design-thinking skills, and to create functional
          products and services to make the world a better place, one happy user
          at a time
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
